# Notebooks

A collection of personal notebooks exploring various datasets and datascience-related concepts and visualisations.

You can view these notebooks using [here](https://github.clerk.garden/loopdreams/notebooks/).

Notebooks are hosted by [Clerk Garden](https://github.clerk.garden/).

These are notebooks that I have made to explore data-analysis using  clojure. I am not a data scientist, nor a statistician (nor a programmer!), I like to explore data analysis and related programming concepts from a hobbyist perspective. If you notice any errors in methodology, or obvious optimizations/improvements that could be made, feel free to let me know!

The primary tools I am using at the moment are:

- [Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk)  -  a notebooking library for clojure
- [Tablecloth](https://github.com/scicloj/tablecloth) - a library for working with columnar datasets in `clojure`, similar to pandas in `python`. It is mainly a wrapper for the more powerful [TMD](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) library.
- [Hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) - For simpler, clojure-style formatting [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specs.

I like these tools because they are very fast to work with and pretty intuitive for the most part.
